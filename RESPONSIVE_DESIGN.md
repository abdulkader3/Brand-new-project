# Responsive Design Implementation

## Overview
The ProductDetails component has been enhanced with responsive design while maintaining the mobile-first approach. The design adapts beautifully across different screen sizes.

## Breakpoint Strategy

### Mobile (Default - up to 767px)
- **Layout**: Single-column vertical layout
- **Padding**: Minimal padding for maximum content area
- **Typography**: Smaller text sizes optimized for mobile reading
- **Buttons**: Compact sizing appropriate for touch interaction
- **Navigation**: Bottom menu bar visible

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- **Layout**: Still single-column but with enhanced spacing
- **Padding**: Increased horizontal padding (md:px-8)
- **Typography**: Medium text sizes for better readability
- **Elements**: Larger interactive elements (color swatches, icons)
- **Image**: Increased height to 500px for better product showcase

### Desktop (1024px+)
- **Layout**: Two-column layout with image on left, details on right
- **Sticky Image**: Product image becomes sticky for better UX during scroll
- **Container**: Maximum width containers with centered content
- **Typography**: Larger text sizes for desktop viewing
- **Spacing**: Enhanced margins and padding throughout
- **Navigation**: Bottom menu bar hidden (lg:hidden)
- **Background**: Clean white background for professional look

## Key Responsive Features

### Image Handling
- Mobile: 400px height, full width
- Tablet: 500px height, maintains aspect ratio
- Desktop: 600px height, sticky positioning, object-cover for proper scaling

### Typography Scaling
- Mobile: text-sm, text-base for content
- Tablet: text-base, text-lg for enhanced readability  
- Desktop: text-lg, text-xl for comfortable desktop viewing

### Interactive Elements

- Heart icon and other interactive elements scale appropriately

### Layout Structure
- Mobile: Vertical stack for easy scrolling
- Desktop: Side-by-side layout with sticky image panel
- Maximum width constraints on desktop to prevent over-stretching

### Enhanced Styling
